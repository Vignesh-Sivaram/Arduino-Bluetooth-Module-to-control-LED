# IoT Project using Arduino and Bluetooth Module to Control LED through Android app

### **Objective and Scope of Project**

This project focuses on developing a system that allows the control of an LED using an Android app via Bluetooth.

The system consists of an Arduino board integrated with an HC-05 Bluetooth module and an LED. Using a custom Android application, the user can manipulate the LED's state (On/Off).

### **Requirements**

#### Hardware Components:
1.	Arduino UNO board
2.	USB cable for connecter Arduino UNO
3.	Bluetooth Module HC-05
4.	Jumper wires male to male
5.	LED
6.	Bread Board
7.	AC 220v/120v home appliances or 9v Hi-Walt Battery

#### Software requirements:
1.	Arduino Software (IDE) on desktop/laptop
2.	â€˜Arduino Bluetooth Controllerâ€™ Android app from Play Store

* ### Connection to Arduino Board:

## Lighting up LED through Arduino IDE

### Approach 1: Via Serial monitor

Serial monitor iconðŸ”Ž on top-right corner of Arduino IDE screen is clicked and 1/0 input message is send indicating On/Off for bulb:

### Approach 2: Via Bluetooth controller App from Play Store in Android

With Arduino board powered by USB cable, HC-05 Bluetooth module starts blinking, which indicates that it is searching for nearby devices.

After installing Arduino Bluetooth Controller from Play Store, open the app and search for the HC-05 device from list of available devices. Pair phone with the Bluetooth device.

After pairing, select Switch mode and configure ON/OFF values to 1 and 0 respectively.

The toggle button appearing on mobile screen acts as switch for the LED.

### Output - LED illumination snap
