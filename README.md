# IoT Project using Arduino and Bluetooth Module to Control LED through Android app

### **Objective and Scope of Project**

This project focuses on developing a system that allows the control of an LED using an Android app via Bluetooth.

The system consists of an Arduino board integrated with an HC-05 Bluetooth module and an LED. Using a custom Android application, the user can manipulate the LED's state (On/Off).

### **Requirements**

#### Hardware Components:
1.	Arduino UNO board
2.	USB cable for connecter Arduino UNO
3.	Bluetooth Module HC-05
4.	Jumper wires male to male
5.	LED
6.	Bread Board
7.	AC 220v/120v home appliances or 9v Hi-Walt Battery

#### Software requirements:
1.	Arduino Software (IDE) on desktop/laptop
2.	‘Arduino Bluetooth Controller’ Android app from Play Store

### Connection to Arduino Board:
